# F1000 Front-end Developer test

Implement the simple image gallery displayed in the wireframe using AngularJS.

Please:

1. Use Flickr apis to fetch the images.
2. When no search keyword is provided return the most recent pictures uploaded on Flickr.
3. Implement a hover state for thumbnails, the arrows on the side of the preview image and for the page numbers.
4. Replace the magnifier with a ‘clear’ icon after a search by keyword is performed and set it back to a magnifier when the current query is modified.
5. Disable the controls when the action is not possible (e.g. the previous page button should be disabled when current page is 1).
6. When reasonable, bind keyboard events to actions.
7. Use font icons for the missing assets.
8. Organise your files and structure your code to maximise readability and maintainability.
